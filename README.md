### **Teachable Machine Demos**
This repository contains three different **Teachable Machine** demos using **Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine framework**. The models are trained to recognize images, audio, and poses, and are integrated into Google Colab for further experimentation.

## **ðŸ§  Project Overview**
We have built three different machine learning models using **Teachable Machine**:
1. **Image-Based Object Classification** â€“ Classifies images of apples, bananas, and oranges.
2. **Audio-Based Sentiment Detection** â€“ Detects voice emotions (happy, neutral, angry).
3. **Pose-Based Activity Recognition** â€“ Recognizes body movements (sitting, standing, jumping).

## **ðŸ“Œ Demo 1: Image-Based Classification**
**Objective**: Classify images of **fruits** (Apples, Bananas, Oranges) using **Teachable Machine**.  
âœ… Trained using **50 images per class**  
âœ… Deployed using **TensorFlow.js** and **Google Colab**  
âœ… Supports **real-time classification**

## **ðŸ“Œ Demo 2: Audio-Based Sentiment Detection**
**Objective**: Train an audio model to recognize **emotions from speech** (Happy, Neutral, Angry).  
âœ… Trained using **Teachable Machine's audio classification**  
âœ… Works with **live microphone input**  
âœ… Uses **Colab for real-time classification**

## **ðŸ“Œ Demo 3: Pose-Based Activity Recognition**
**Objective**: Train a model to classify **human poses** (Sitting, Standing, Jumping).  
âœ… Uses **Teachable Machine's Pose Model**  
âœ… Works with **webcam-based pose recognition**  
âœ… Integrated with **Google Colab for real-time testing**
